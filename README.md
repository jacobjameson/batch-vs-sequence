This project investigates the impact of physician test ordering behavior on patient outcomes and resource utilization in the emergency department (ED). The study compares the effects of batch ordering (ordering multiple diagnostic imaging tests at once) versus non-batch ordering (including sequential testing and single test or no test strategies) on patient length of stay, 72-hour return rates, and the number of imaging tests ordered.

## Key Findings

The study highlights the heterogeneity in the effects of batch ordering across different clinical conditions and patient acuity levels. The main findings suggest that:

1. Batch ordering is associated with increased patient length of stay and a higher number of imaging tests ordered, particularly among high-acuity patients.
2. The effect of batch ordering on 72-hour return rates varies by patient complaint, with a reduction in return rates observed for patients presenting with cardiac/chest-related complaints.
3. The study emphasizes the need for diagnostic strategies that consider the heterogeneity in the effects of batch ordering to optimize operational efficiency and quality of care in the ED.
