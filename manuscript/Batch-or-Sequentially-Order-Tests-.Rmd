abstract: "An analysis of data from over 41,000 patient visits to the Emergency Department (ED) at the Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, AZ, reveal high variance in physician tendency to batch-order versus sequentially-order diagnostic tests within the same hospital. Among the reasons for a patient's visit to the ED, [insert chief complaint] had the greatest variability in test ordering practices and made up approximately [insert percent] of all ED visits during the study period. Test ordering strategies may play an important role in optimizing ED workflows, improving patient care, and reducing unnecessary costs in healthcare."

# Introduction

Emergency Departments (EDs) remain at the forefront of healthcare delivery, often grappling with inefficiencies that impact patient outcomes and the broader health system. One potential determinant of these inefficiencies lies in the diagnostic test-ordering practices of physicians. Drawing from data from over 41,000 ED visits at the Mayo Clinic of Arizona, we observed a pronounced variability in physicians' tendencies to batch-order or sequentially-order diagnostic tests. Interestingly, these variations persisted even among physicians practicing under the same guidelines within an identical hospital setting.

This variation was most palpable among prevalent chief complaints in the ED, such as abdominal issues and back pain. The data indicated that differences in test-ordering practices were not mere anomalies but were rooted in individual clinical judgment and preference (as depicted in Exhibit 1). Our preliminary findings underscore a potential imperative: crafting or refining guidelines that target test-ordering strategies, thereby optimizing ED operations, curbing unnecessary expenditures, and enhancing patient outcomes.

# Study Data and Methods

**Setting and Sample**: Our analytical lens is focused on the Emergency Department at the Mayo Clinic of Arizona, a distinguished tertiary care establishment. During our study's timeframe, the ED recorded an annual visitation of approximately 41,000 patients. The department is singularly staffed by board-eligible or board-certified emergency physicians, abstaining from the services of nurse practitioners or physician assistants. A notable observation was that residents in rotation oversaw a low fraction, roughly 10%, of the patient volume.

**Data Compilation**: Comprehensive patient data, encompassing demographics, chief complaints, vital signs, emergency severity, length of stay, and resource utilization metrics, were meticulously logged during the study period.

**Physician Assignment Process**: Contrary to most healthcare settings where patients exhibit choice, in the ED, they are predominantly passive in their physician assignment. In most EDs, however, physicians have discretion in picking their patients. In contrast, patients arriving at the Mayo Clinic ED are randomly assigned to physicians via a rotational patient assignment algorithm (Traub et al., 2016), which removes potential selection bias concerns for our analyses. In essence, barring arrival time and shift-level variation, the physician-to-patient matching can be deemed random. Table 1 displays that patient encounters (in terms of chief complaints and emergency severity) are equitably distributed across physicians within our study's cohort.

\emph{Notes:} The Wald test was conducted to assess the balance of chief complaints across providers in our dataset. A balanced distribution implies that complaints are evenly distributed across providers, which we expect to be the case due to randomization. The Wald F-statistic and p-value are reported. Robust standard errors (type HC1) were used to account for potential heteroscedasticity in the data.

# Study Results


We identified three distinct forms of test batching:

- Lab/Image Batch: The first test ordered for a patient was either an imaging or lab test (CT scan, X-ray, Ultrasound, Lab), followed by an additional imaging or lab test order within 5 minutes.

- Image/Image Batch: The first test ordered for a patient was an imaging test (CT scan, X-ray, Ultrasound), followed by an additional imaging test order within 5 minutes.

- Any Batch: This refers to instances where either a Lab/Image Batch or an Image/Image Batch occurred.


Table 1 provides a comprehensive breakdown of the patient encounters involving diagnostic tests ordered either individually (Sequential) or as part of a group (Batch) during an ED encounter from our baseline sample. Around 43% of patient encounters involved diagnostic tests ordered as part of a batch, the majority of which (60%) included two tests.

Differences were noted between the two cohorts. Patients who had batched tests ordered tended to have a longer ED length of stay, a lower Emergency Severity Index (ESI), and were generally older than those who had their tests ordered individually. Patients in the batch order group were also more likely to present with symptoms at triage, including tachycardia, tachypnea, fever, and hypotension. A deeper dive into the ESI data reveals a higher proportion of patients with more urgent conditions (ESI 1 and 2) in the batched group than in the sequential group. This finding might be indicative of the complexity and severity of the conditions of patients who necessitate batch testing.

Age distributions between the two groups demonstrate a greater proportion of patients aged 65 and above in the batch group, suggesting that older patients are more likely to have multiple tests ordered at once, possibly due to the presence of multiple comorbidities. The batched group showed a longer average ED length of stay compared to the sequential group. This extended stay may be reflective of the additional time required to conduct and evaluate the results of multiple tests. Symptoms presentation at triage also differed between the two groups, with the batched group being more likely to present with tachypnea, fever, and hypotension. However, tachycardia was found to be similar across both groups.
